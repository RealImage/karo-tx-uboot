config LED
	bool "Enable LED support"
	depends on DM
	help
	  Many boards have LEDs which can be used to signal status or alerts.
	  U-Boot provides a uclass API to implement this feature. LED drivers
	  can provide access to board-specific LEDs. Use of the device tree
	  for configuration is encouraged.

config SPL_LED_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable LED support in SPL"
	depends on LED
	help
	  The LED subsystem adds a small amount of overhead to the image.
	  If this is acceptable and you have a need to use LEDs in SPL,
	  enable this option. You will need to enable device tree in SPL
	  for this to work.
