	  Enable driver model for I2C. The I2C uclass interface: probe, read,
	  write and speed, is implemented with the bus drivers operations,
	  which provide methods for bus setting and data transfer. Each chip
	  device (bus child) info is kept as parent platdata. The interface
	  is defined in include/i2c.h. When i2c bus driver supports the i2c
	  uclass, but the device drivers not, then DM_I2C_COMPAT config can
	  be used as compatibility layer.

	help
	  Enable old-style I2C functions for compatibility with existing code.
	  This option can be enabled as a temporary measure to avoid needing
	  to convert all code for a board in a single commit. It should not
	  be enabled for any board in an official release.
