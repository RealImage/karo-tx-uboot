config SOUND
	bool "Enable sound support"
	help
	  Support making sounds through an audio codec. This is normally a
	  beep at a chosen frequency for a selected length of time. However
	  the drivers support playing arbitrary sound samples using a
	  PCM interface.

	  Note: At present the sound setup is somewhat tangled up in that the
	  audio codecs are called from the sound-i2s code. This could be
	  converted to driver model.

config I2S
	bool "Enable I2S support"
	depends on SOUND
	help
	  I2S is a serial bus often used to transmit audio data from the
	  SoC to the audio codec. This option enables sound support using
	  I2S. It calls either of the two supported codecs (no use is made
	  of driver model at present).
