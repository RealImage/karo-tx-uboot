	  Support making sounds through an audio codec. This is normally a
	  beep at a chosen frequency for a selected length of time. However
	  the drivers support playing arbitrary sound samples using a
	  PCM interface.

	  Note: At present the sound setup is somewhat tangled up in that the
	  audio codecs are called from the sound-i2s code. This could be
	  converted to driver model.
