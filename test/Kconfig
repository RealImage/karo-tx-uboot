config CMD_UT_TIME
	bool "Unit tests for time functions"
	help
	  Enables the 'ut_time' command which tests that the time functions
	  work correctly. The test is fairly simple and will not catch all
	  problems. But if you are having problems with udelay() and the like,
	  this is a good place to start.
