                                        U-Boot for TX6
                                        ==============

Building U-Boot
---------------

Note: There are currently six variants of the TX6 module, that
      require slightly different U-Boot configurations. They are
      distinguished through the 'TX6' suffix 'Q' or 'U' and the
      numerical suffix of the module name. Replace the '?' in the
      following description with the corresponding digits from your
      TX6 module.
      E.g. TX6Q-1010 => 'make tx6q-1010_config'

Unpacking the source
--------------------
mkdir u-boot
cd u-boot
tar -xjf /cdrom/U-Boot/u-boot-src.tar.bz2

Alternatively you can access the current source via the git repository:
git://git.karo-electronics.de/karo-tx-uboot.git master


Compiling U-Boot
----------------
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-cortexa9-linux-gnueabi-
make tx6?-??1?_config            (see above Note!)
make


Flashing U-Boot Image
---------------------
If you want to replace a working U-Boot with a new version, you can
load the new U-Boot image via TFTP or SD-Card and write it to flash
with the 'romupdate' command.

If you want to revive a bricked module, U-Boot can be downloaded via
USB with the 'sbloader' tool in recovery boot mode (Bootmode jumper ST3
on Starterkit-5 baseboard closed). See TX6_U-Boot.pdf for details.

e.g.: /cdrom/Flashtools/Linux/sbloader/sbloader-x86_32 -m -s /cdrom/U-Boot/target/u-boot-tx6q-1010.bin
(This command can be used from within the ARMSK-VM)

MfgTool
-------
For Windows users the application MfgTool allows the (re-)flashing of
U-Boot. For more information either see:

\U-Boot\TX6Q_U-Boot.pdf
\STK5_TX6Q_Quickstart_Guide.pdf
\Flashtools\Windows\Mfgtools-TX6...


U-Boot Features
---------------

Environment variables:

cpu_clk       <CPU freq [MHz]> CPU clock frequency set after boot.

touchpanel    {tsc2007|edt-ft5x06|egalax_ts} type of touchpanel.
	      No touchpanel will be enabled when unset.

otg_mode      [host|device|none] operation mode of the USBOTG port

video_mode    <one of the display names from the Glyn Family Concept or
	      a video mode as understood by Linux fb_find_mode() function
              (e.g.: 640x480MR-24@60)>
	      LCD interface will be disabled when unset.

baseboard     {stk5-v3|stk5-v5} selects type of baseboard
	      'stk5-v5' setting disables USB Host mode on USBOTG port
	      and redefines the LCD0 pin as CAN transceiver control pin.
	      Strings not starting in 'stk5' prevent the STK5 specific
	      pad initialization to be done.

splashimage   either: memory address (e.g. ${loadaddr}) of a BMP file
	      to be displayed instead of the built-in logo. Since NAND
	      flash is not accessible in a memory mapped fashion,
	      U-Boot will try to load the contents of the flash
	      partition 'logo.bmp' to the address given with
	      'splashimage'.

	      or: the name of an MTD partition, that contains a raw
	      dump of the frame buffer contents which will be loaded
	      to the framebuffer.

splashpos     (when 'splashimage' contains a memory address) the
	      position ('x,y') on the screen at which the BMP image
	      will be displayed.
	      Setting splashpos to 'm,m' will center the image on the
	      screen.

Note: Some variables (like 'cpu_clk' or 'splashimage') may render the
      board unbootable if incorrectly set. Therefore these variables
      will not be evaluated in case the board has been reset through a
      watchdog reset or <CTRL-C> is detected on the serial console
      during startup to give the user a chance to recover from this
      situation. You should press and hold <CTRL-C> before applying
      power to the module, for this to work.
